# YelpCamp
	- It has been created using BOOTSTRAP v4.5 for the fornt end,and nodeJS,mongoDb,express,passport,etc for the backend(for the full list,check out dependencies).
	- Users can sign up/login, add campgrounds with price name,etc.
	- Users can also comment on campgrounds.
	- Edit and Delete permisions are only given to the people who have made those comments or submitted the campgrounds.
	- If you don't have permissions then the edit/delete buttons for the comments/campgrounds will be hidden as well...
	- Flash messges were included as well.
	- Currently it has been hosted on Heroku and  MongoAtlas.
	- The last actual commit was adding the time counter for the submission dates for comments and campgrounds using momentjs.
> I'll be adding new features with time. In the mean while check out the current version,give feedback,play with it.	
## Thanks and Cheers!.
